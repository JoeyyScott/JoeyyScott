+ 👀 A few things to know about me and what I do:
+ ⏳ One of my main life mentalities - I believe that time is more valuable than money as you can make more money but you can't get your time back.
+ 🕹 I've been a gamer the majority of my life and it holds a special place in my heart as I've made some of my best friends through it and learned a considerable amount.
+ 💡 I'm a content creator who always has a new idea and does a variety of things included but not limited to: Gaming, graphic design, music production, clothing designs and coding.

### Other interests

+ **MIRC** - I've coded a fair amount in mIRC developing chat bots for IRC channels.
+ **ReactJS** - I've done some research into this and definitely want to learn more once my course is complete.
+ **TypeScript** - From what I've seen this JavaScript 'extension' seems to provide a lot of functionality for issues I was having during the development of my MS2 project.
